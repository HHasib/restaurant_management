### Note: This was my first experience with programming so the algorithm is the not good at all.

# What is it?
This is a simple restaurant management software created using python3. This was created paricularly particular for my school's yearly food fest. This program utilises the tkinter library for GUI interface. It takes input from users for each receipt and exports all the receipt to an excel spreadshhet.All the revenues are stored for later use.In the program there are buttons on which the user clicks to add to the cart. All the calculations are automatic and done in fractions of a second.There is also an option to calculate how much money to return back to the customer.

# How to use it?
1.There are buttons regarding each food and pressing on them adds it to the cart.Doble clicking it adds two of them and so on.
2.Each food item has a corresponding minus sign button beside the no. of food. Clicking on them removes a corresponding food item, two clicks remove two of them and so on.The total price is also auto adjusted.
3.After an order is made and you want to move to the next order press the "Next" button (green button). Tis will save all the data and clear the screen for the next order. DO NOT use the "Reset" button to place an order.
4. If u make any major mistakes and want to clear the screen. Press the "Reset" button (red button) and then take the correct order.
